  <p><br>I'm an undergrad at the University of Washington studying computer science and neuroscience.
     <br>
     <br>I'm interested in synthetic biology, evolutionary neuroscience, and developing open-source tools for applications in neuroscience.
         I've worked on projects engineering assays using DNA nanotechnology, predicting evolutionary relationships using deep learning, and 
         Iâ€™m drawn to research at the intersection of molecular biology and neuroscience.</p>
