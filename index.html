  <p><br>I'm an undergrad at the University of Washington studying <b>computer science</b> and <b>neuroscience</b>. 
         I entered UW at 15 through the Robinson Center for Young Scholars. 
     <br>
     <br>I'm interested in synthetic biology, evolutionary neuroscience, and developing open-source tools for applications in neuroscience.
         I've worked on projects engineering assays using DNA nanotechnology, predicting evolutionary relationships using deep learning, and 
         Iâ€™m drawn to research at the intersection of molecular biology and neuroscience.</p>
      <br>
      <br>Outside of school, you can find me trying new coffee-shops, playing guitar, and reading (give me book recs <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf2ecQeGqaqFEQMbKIqfYG6z0xDB-LVDCr02MgOOSlRtXgK4g/viewform?usp=header">here</a>).
